When it comes to security research, ethics becomes even more critical.\n\n## Why Ethics Matter in AI Security\n\nAs AI systems become more powerful, the potential for misuse grows. Security researchers must:\n\n- Understand the difference between ethical research and malicious hacking\n- Follow responsible disclosure practices\n- Consider the broader implications of their findings\n- Protect vulnerable systems and users\n\n## The Researcher's Responsibility\n\n**Do No Harm:** The primary principle is to avoid causing damage.\n\n**Transparency:** Be clear about your intentions and methods.\n\n**Accountability:** Take responsibility for the outcomes of your research.",
