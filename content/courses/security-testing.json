AI systems have different attack surfaces and vulnerabilities.\n\n## Key Differences from Traditional Testing\n\n- AI behavior can be unpredictable\n- Attacks exploit model behavior, not code bugs\n- Testing requires understanding of ML concepts\n- Vulnerabilities may be probabilistic\n\n## Assessment Framework\n\n### 1. Model Analysis\n\n- What type of model?\n- What are its capabilities?\n- How is it deployed?\n\n### 2. Attack Surface Mapping\n\n- Input vectors\n- Output channels\n- Integration points\n- Data sources\n\n### 3. Threat Modeling\n\n- Who might attack?\n- What are their goals?\n- What damage could occur?",
